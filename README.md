Run `Stampede.py` to see the simulation.

To interpret the results, see files `stampede_initial.png` and `stampede_final.png`. `stampede_initial.png` is printed before the simulation runs, and `stampede_final.png` is printed at the end of the simulation. 

Color code:
* red dots are players who are alive
* blue dots are players who are fallen but still alive
* green dots are players who are fallen and dead
